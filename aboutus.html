A substantial portion of this population belongs to the age group of 20 to 25 which is the most promising employable sector of the Indian population. The career opportunities and possibilities that any individual can indulge into, is growing exponentially. With an exponential boom in the number of students willing to take up the potential fields of engineering, management and pharmacy as a career option and the consequent growth in the number of institutions providing the same, an intriguing question arises, does our country render the proportional number of vacancies in the mentioned fields and most importantly does our country need this prodigious number of graduated in this domain?<br>
